This script is essentially a web page change detection system. It scrapes a specific webpage periodically and checks if the content has changed since the last check. If a change is detected, it sends a notification.

This tool provides a versatile solution for monitoring any webpage for updates, which can be particularly useful for pages that lack their own notification systems for changes or updates. However, it's crucial to exercise caution and ensure that the website being scraped permits such activity. Unauthorized scraping may violate the website's terms of service and could lead to legal consequences.

Please note that the effectiveness of the script might be impacted if the webpage relies heavily on dynamic content loading, as it may not capture real-time changes. Additionally, web scraping can put a strain on both the web server and the network, so responsible and considerate usage is advised.

Always verify the website's terms of use and obtain proper authorization before implementing any scraping activities. Respect the site's policies and limitations to avoid any potential issues while utilizing this change detection system.
